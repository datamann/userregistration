# User Registration

A Spring Boot REST API and Vaadin Hilla frontend for user registration.

## Description

The User Registration feature has no practical use, this project is created to demonstrate the difference between "IN APP" authorizations and "EXTERNAL" or policy-based authorizations.

Versions:
* The branch "in_app_authorization" will use "internal" authorizations only, based on roles. These roles are injected into the authentication JWT token from the external authentication service, Keycloak.
* The branch "external_authorization" will use OpenPoliyAgent https://www.openpolicyagent.org/ for authorizations. The application will receive roles and attributes from Keycloak, and forward the data to OPA for authorization approval. OPA as a PDP will only make an "allow/not allow" decision based on data it receives from Keycloak via the application. The enforcement of the policy is done by the application.


## Getting Started
